# Self-balancing-Two-wheeled-vehicle
Design the control system of a stationary self balancing two-wheeled vehicle

## Brief Introduction
We have the state space linear model for the two-wheeled vehicle:
$\dot{x} = Ax + Bu$
$y = Cx$
The state variable is $x = ([car_position, handle_angle, bike_angle, \dot{car_position}, \dot{handle_angle}, \dot{bike_angle}])^T$
